# Coffe shop digital menu
**Description:**
This project is a digital interactive menu of a coffe shop to show clients the dishes and drinks sold in the cafe. Products are classified in different categories (coffe, drinks, milkshakes, appetizers, main courses and desserts). Instead of using a static digital menu, as used in many restaurants, users can see each dish' image, description, and price. Then, they can add their dishes to create an order and show to the ordering station using a QR code to be captured.
